He walked up and down the docks and counted and inventoried the containers coming off the ships. He was on his feet all day, in the sun all day. I remember he was always very tan. He wore his cowboy boots every day. Every night, I remember, he would wait for a phone call to say, “We need you to work tomorrow, this is the dock you report to.” And if you didn't get that phone call, then you didn't work.

If I had to sum up all the things I heard then or what I’ve since talked to other family members about, it’s that there’s a tension for them. Somebody like my father who didn’t have a college degree could work for the port and earn a good living. He could be in the union and have health care and a savings account with the credit union. But it was very grueling work. He was exhausted at the end of the day when he came home. It required a sacrifice of your body.
