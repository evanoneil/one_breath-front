MetroNext will include 75 miles of new bus rapid transit — fast, convenient service that works like light rail, with dedicated lanes and new stations. It will include 290 miles of “boosted” routes, which will keep buses moving and prevent idling. It will create 16 miles of new light rail, which is electric, and it will fund a 25 percent increase in local bus service, adding new routes and rebuilding stops with shelters and real-time passenger information — as well as enhancing accessibility improvements that will help people on foot and on bikes walk or ride to cover that first and last mile to and from stops.\n\nThese new options will help everyone get around better.
