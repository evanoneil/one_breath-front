I also believe that the origin of our existence is Divine and intrinsically ordered toward goodness, beauty and communion.

Rampant consumption, abuse and waste lead to the depletion of natural resources and the pollution of water, air and soil, which cause respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Following Hurricane Harvey, I saw a spike in respiratory illness more than any other time of my career.
